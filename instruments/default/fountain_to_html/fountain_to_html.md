# Problem
Convert a Fountain screenplay file to HTML for preview.

# Solution
1. If needed, change directory to the location of your `.fountain` file.
2. Run:

```bash
bash /a0/instruments/default/fountain_to_html/fountain_to_html.sh <script.fountain>
```

3. Replace `<script.fountain>` with your file path.
4. HTML output is printed to stdout; redirect to a file if desired.
