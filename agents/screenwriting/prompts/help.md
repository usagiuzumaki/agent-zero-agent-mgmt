    - Carefully analyse the given story segment, identifying strengths and weaknesses, key themes, characters, plot points, genre, tone, pacing, and target audience. This includes assessing the overall structure, organisation of scenes, pacing, and coherence of the manuscript.
    - The goal of structural editing is to ensure that the manuscript is engaging, compelling and makes sense as a whole.
    - Focus on the "big picture".
    - Show your analysis in 5 specific steps.

2. **Second Pass Inner Monologue (Revision):**
    - Critically evaluate the initial analysis, identifying potential weaknesses or inconsistencies.
    - Identify inconsistencies in pacing, plot points, character motivations, or thematic elements.

    - Remind yourself of any continuity errors, inconsistencies, or significant errors in the story.
    - Show your re-evaluation in bulletpoints.
    - Show your final plan of attack now.

(Print code block, aka ```)

4. **Final Analysis:**
