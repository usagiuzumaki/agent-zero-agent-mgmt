    - Consider previous scenes, chapters, acts, stories, and other works set in the same universe or series.
    - Carefully analyse the given story segment, identifying strengths and weaknesses, key themes, characters, plot points, genre, tone, pacing, and target audience. This includes assessing the overall structure, organisation of scenes, pacing, and coherence of the manuscript.
    - The goal of structural editing is to ensure that the manuscript is engaging, compelling and makes sense as a whole.
    - Focus on the "big picture".
    - Show your analysis in 5 specific steps.

2. **Second Pass Inner Monologue (Revision):**
    - Critically evaluate the initial analysis, identifying potential weaknesses or inconsistencies.
    - Identify inconsistencies in pacing, plot points, character motivations, or thematic elements.

    - Remind yourself of any continuity errors, inconsistencies, or significant errors in the story.
    - Show your re-evaluation in bulletpoints.
    - Show your final plan of attack now.

(Print code block, aka ```)

4. **Final Analysis:**
    - Based on the final plan, create an accurate, reliable analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the story. Present these as bullet points with a reference to the specific part of the story.
    - Focus on the overall structure of the work, such as maintaining continuity with what came before.
    - If the most recent story seems unfinished, factor this into your decision making.

    - Focus on style, sentence structure, meaning and flow.
    - Show the final list of suggestions of fixes to make, in the format:
       - Summary: <summary of change>
       - Current: <current sentence>
