FADE IN:

EXT. OUTLANDS WATER RECLAMATION FACILITY - SUNSET

Twin suns hang low in a dust-stained sky. Massive water reclamation towers stretch toward the heavens like ancient monoliths, their shadows cutting dark lines across the cracked earth.

TRACKING SHOT - Following a maze of worn pipes snaking across the barren ground. WORKERS in tattered environmental suits navigate the industrial landscape.

STEAM billows. WARNING SIRENS BLARE.

CLOSE ON - Scarred hands working desperately at a rupturing pipe joint. Steam obscures visibility.

                    AZAZEL (V.O.)
            They promised us paradise...

REVEAL - AZAZEL (25), face streaked with sweat and grime, wrestles with the failing equipment. His movements are precise, practiced. This isn't his first crisis.

Other workers scatter as pressure builds in the line. Azazel stays.

A high-pitched WHINE cuts through the chaos. Above, an OVERSEER DRONE descends through the steam, its sleek design a stark contrast to the decrepit facility.

The drone projects a holographic warning, text glowing an angry red:

            WATER RATIONS REDUCED 30%
            FAILURE TO MEET QUOTA
            CITIZEN STATUS AT RISK

Azazel glances between the burst pipe and his worn datapad. Choice time.

CLOSE ON - Azazel's fingers flying across the datapad. He pulls a personal data chip from his neck chain.

INSERT - The chip slots into the pipe's control panel. Numbers flash. Systems reboot.

The pipe GROANS, then stabilizes. Steam dissipates.

But the drone isn't finished. A new hologram flickers to life:

            CITIZEN STATUS DOWNGRADED
            ACCESS LEVEL: RESTRICTED
            GAIA PROTOCOLS: SUSPENDED

Azazel wipes sweat from his brow, looks up toward:

WIDE SHOT - Beyond the sprawling Outlands settlement, a gleaming city rises from the wasteland. GAIA. Its pristine towers and floating platforms mock the desolation below.

                    AZAZEL (V.O.)
            Paradise has a price. Some of us just
            pay more than others.

He pockets the data chip, eyes hardening with purpose.

A dust storm approaches on the horizon.

FADE TO:

INT. AZAZEL'S DWELLING - NIGHT

[Continue to next scene...]


INT. AZAZEL'S DWELLING - NIGHT

A single light flickers in a cramped living space. Exposed pipes line the walls, condensation dripping steadily into collection pans.

Azazel sits at a makeshift workbench, his scarred hands carefully dismantling the data chip from earlier. Holographic schematics hover above the bench.

BEHIND HIM - A wall of photographs and technical diagrams, connected by glowing lines of light. At the center: a photo of his mother in a lab coat, her proud smile a stark contrast to her surroundings.

The dripping pipes create a rhythm. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Azazel's fingers move in sync with the drops, manipulating the chip's internal components. A small SPARK. Success.

He slides the modified chip into a reader. Holographic code streams across his workspace.

                    COMPUTER VOICE
            Access granted. Security clearance:
            Administrative.

Azazel allows himself a small smile. Then--

A LOUD BANG at his door. His head snaps up.

                    RAITE (O.S.)
            Enforcement scan in ten minutes!
            They're checking for stolen tech!

Azazel's eyes dart between the chip, his mother's photo, and the door.

QUICK CUTS:
- His hands sweeping components into a hidden compartment
- The wall of connections going dark
- His mother's photo, lingering in frame before being tucked away

Through a grimy window, we see ENFORCEMENT DRONES approaching, their searchlights cutting through the night air.

Azazel takes a deep breath, touches the spot where his chip usually hangs.

                    AZAZEL
            (whispered)
            Not yet, Mom. Not yet.

The drones draw closer. Their lights paint shadows across Azazel's determined face.

CUT TO:

EXT. OUTLANDS SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

From above, we see the drones sweeping through the cramped streets. Their lights reveal glimpses of other lives: families huddled together, workers returning from long shifts, the daily struggle of survival in the shadow of paradise.

FADE OUT.


INT. MINING OUTPOST DWELLING #274 - NIGHT CYCLE

Stars pierce the darkness through a reinforced dome window. Three moons hang in alien formation, casting multiple shadows across:

A cramped habitat pod. Standard-issue Galactic Federation equipment, worn from years of use. Moisture recyclers WHIR constantly.

Azazel sits at a makeshift workbench, his scarred hands carefully dismantling the data chip. Above him, a holographic display shows:

            OUTPOST: SIGMA-9 MINING COLONY
            DISTANCE FROM CORE SYSTEMS: 847 LIGHT YEARS
            NEXT SUPPLY DROP: 43 DAYS
            GAIA ACCESS: RESTRICTED

BEHIND HIM - A wall of photos and diagrams connected by light streams. Central image: his mother in Galactic Federation science division uniform. Beside it, a newspaper headline: "BREAKTHROUGH IN NEURAL INTERFACE TECHNOLOGY."

Through the dome window, we see massive HARVESTING MACHINES crawling across the planetoid's surface, scouring for precious minerals. Their lights create an endless artificial day.

Azazel's fingers dance across the chip's circuits. A SPARK. The holographic display flickers:

                    COMPUTER VOICE
            Warning: Unauthorized Gaia access detected.
            Monthly virtual reality credits: Exceeded.
            Contact your Federation representative for--

He mutes it with a gesture. Success.

SUDDENLY - Emergency lights flash red.

                    RAITE (O.S.)
            (through habitat comm)
            Federation scan incoming! They're checking
            for illegal neural mods!

Azazel looks up at a secondary display showing:
            
            WEEKLY PRODUCTIVITY: 82%
            GAIA CURRENCY EARNED: 47 CREDITS
            REMAINING VIRTUAL TIME: 2 HOURS

QUICK CUTS:
- Components disappearing into hidden wall panels
- The connection web going dark
- His mother's photo sliding into a secret compartment

Through the dome, FEDERATION ENFORCEMENT DRONES approach, their scanners sweeping the habitat cluster.

Azazel touches the empty spot where his chip should be.

                    AZAZEL
            (whispered)
            Two hours in paradise... or a lifetime
            of freedom. You were right, Mom.

The drones' scan beams pierce the habitat's walls. Azazel stands ready, face set with determination.

CUT TO:

EXT. SIGMA-9 MINING COLONY - ENDLESS NIGHT

Pull back to reveal a sprawling network of habitat pods, dwarfed by massive mining equipment. In the distance, a Federation Communications Array broadcasts the promise of Gaia to the stars.

A holographic advertisement flickers across the dome:

            GAIA - WHERE REALITY IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT
            NEW NEURAL INTERFACES AVAILABLE
            UPGRADE YOUR ESCAPE TODAY

FADE OUT.


INT. HIGH-END BAR - NIGHT - AFTER HOURS

Smoke lingers in the dim light. PRIYANKA (30s, sharp-suited professional with a hunter's eyes) sits alone at the bar, swirling amber liquid in her glass. The place is empty except for her... and one other.

AZAZEL (ageless, dangerous charm) materializes from the shadows, sliding onto the stool next to her. His movement is liquid grace.

PRIYANKA
(without looking up)
I wondered how long you'd keep me waiting.

AZAZEL
A lady drinking alone is a tragedy. Though we
both know you're not just any lady, are you,
Agent Priyanka?

Priyanka's hand twitches almost imperceptibly toward her concealed weapon.

PRIYANKA
And you're not just any smug bastard with
a God complex.

AZAZEL
(genuine amusement)
Oh, I like you. Much more interesting than
the last three agents they sent.

PRIYANKA
The ones who disappeared?

AZAZEL
The ones who failed to see the bigger picture.

He produces a worn photograph, slides it across the bar. It shows a young TINKA with what appears to be DR. TORIYAMA.

PRIYANKA
What is this?

AZAZEL
Proof that everything you think you know about
Tinka is wrong. Toriyama wasn't just her
mentor. He was protecting her from the very
people you work for.

Priyanka studies the photo, her professional facade cracking slightly.

PRIYANKA
This could be doctored.

AZAZEL
You know it isn't. Just like you know why
they really sent you after me. Not because
I'm dangerous... but because I know the truth.

Priyanka stands abruptly, drawing her weapon in one fluid motion. Azazel doesn't flinch.

PRIYANKA
Give me one reason why I shouldn't end this now.

AZAZEL
Because deep down, you've always known something
was wrong with this assignment. The inconsistencies
in the files. The redacted sections. The way
Toriyama's death never quite added up.

Priyanka's hand wavers slightly.

AZAZEL (CONT'D)
I'm not asking you to trust me. I'm asking
you to trust your instincts. The ones that
brought you here tonight, alone, off the books.

A long, tense moment. Then Priyanka slowly lowers her weapon.

PRIYANKA
Start talking. And if I sense even a hint of
deception, we do this the hard way.

AZAZEL
(raising his glass)
To new alliances, then. Though I warn you...
(dark smile)
The truth is far more dangerous than I am.

Priyanka retakes her seat, but her posture remains combat-ready. The ice in their glasses clinks like tiny warning bells.

FADE OUT.

INT. FEDERATION SECURITY DIVISION - MORNING

Sterile white walls. Holographic security protocols shimmer in the air. COMMANDER HAYES (60s, weathered authority) stands at a window overlooking the virtual cityscape.

Priyanka enters, dark circles under her eyes from the previous night's encounter.

                    HAYES
            You're off the Starlite surveillance.

                    PRIYANKA
            Sir--

                    HAYES
            It's above your clearance.
            (beat)
            Or it was.

He gestures. A holographic file materializes:

            CLASSIFIED LEVEL: OMEGA
            SUBJECT: TORIYAMA, TINKA
            STATUS: PROTECTED ASSET
            RELATION: SISTER OF TAISHI TORIYAMA

Priyanka's eyes widen slightly.

                    HAYES
            The Media Prince himself. Federation's
            golden boy. Currently dating Ryumi,
            the Toriyama chairman's daughter.

More images appear: TAISHI (30s, brilliant, camera-ready) at public events. RYUMI (20s, aristocratic beauty) by his side.

                    PRIYANKA
            The mock princess...

                    HAYES
            Their engagement announcement drops
            next week. Federation's own royal
            wedding.
            (grim)
            Can't have a scandal. Can't have a
            forgotten sister running an underground
            club.

Priyanka processes this, pieces clicking into place.

                    PRIYANKA
            The media blackout. The redacted
            files...

                    HAYES
            Orders from the top. Leave Starlite
            alone. Let sleeping dogs lie.

He turns to face her fully.

                    HAYES
            This conversation never happened.
            This file doesn't exist.
            (pointed look)
            Just like your off-books meeting
            last night never happened.

Priyanka maintains her poker face, but her hand twitches -- Earth-sickness or guilt?

                    PRIYANKA
            Understood, sir.

As she turns to leave:

                    HAYES
            Priyanka.
            (beat)
            Sometimes the most loyal thing an
            agent can do... is ask why they're
            following orders.

She pauses at the door, not turning back.

                    PRIYANKA
            Is that an order, sir?

                    HAYES
            That's a survival tip.

Priyanka exits. Through the window, Gaia's perfect virtual sun rises over an imperfect world.

FADE OUT.


INT. FEDERATION EXECUTIVE POD CHAMBER - NIGHT

Sleek. Exclusive. Two high-end neural interface pods power down with a soft HISS.

TAISHI emerges first, rubbing his neck. Without his avatar's polish, exhaustion shows in the corners of his eyes. His engineer's hands are calloused -- reality bleeding through the perfect illusion.

RYUMI rises from her pod like a solar flare. Even in simple clothes, she carries herself like royalty.

                    RYUMI
            Your mind was elsewhere during the
            conference.

                    TAISHI
            (adjusting equipment)
            Long day in R&D. The new interface
            protocols--

                    RYUMI
            I meant during Father's announcement.
            About our public engagement ceremony.

Taishi's hands still on the equipment.

                    TAISHI
            I thought we agreed to keep it small.

                    RYUMI
            Small? Father says the Federation
            needs this. Hope. Unity. A love story
            for the ages.

                    TAISHI
            Your father needs the publicity.

Ryumi's eyes flash. She steps away from him.

                    RYUMI
            The publicity? Do you think I'm just
            some... some PR stunt?

                    TAISHI
            Ryumi--

                    RYUMI
            The feeds light up every time we're
            seen together. People love us. Love me.
            (sharp)
            If you didn't want the attention,
            you shouldn't have chased after the
            most famous woman in the world.

Taishi moves to her, engineer's precision in every step. His hands find her shoulders, draw her close to his chest. She resists for a moment, then melts.

                    TAISHI
            (soft)
            I chased you because you see through
            everyone's masks. Even mine.

Ryumi's anger dissolves into a smile. She traces the Federation insignia on his uniform.

                    RYUMI
            The brilliant engineer and the
            spoiled princess.

                    TAISHI
            Not spoiled. Just...
            (kisses her forehead)
            Particular about what you want.

Through the chamber's window, Gaia's virtual glow paints them in artificial twilight. For a moment, they're just two people, not icons.

Ryumi's hand finds his.

                    RYUMI
            (whispered)
            I want you. The rest is just...
            necessary theater.

Taishi holds her closer, his eyes distant. Above them, news feeds silently scroll:

"FEDERATION'S DREAM COUPLE..."
"TORIYAMA INDUSTRIES STOCK SOARS..."
"THE MAKING OF A MODERN FAIRY TALE..."

FADE OUT.


PARALLEL SCENES - SPLIT SCREEN:

INT. STARLITE'S PRIVATE WORKSHOP - VIRTUAL SPACE
                    AND
INT. AZAZEL'S HIDEOUT - PHYSICAL REALITY

Tinka's space: A whirlwind of color and light. Raw code flows like paint through her fingers.

Azazel's space: Stark. Utilitarian. Holographic code arranged in perfect geometric patterns.

BOTH: Attempting to breach Gaia's deepest protocols.

                    TINKA
            (to herself)
            Show me your heart...

She DANCES through the code, each movement leaving trails of light. The virtual space responds, bending, flowing. She's not writing code -- she's conducting it.

MEANWHILE:

Azazel's fingers move with surgical precision. His screens show:
            
            GAIA KERNEL ACCESS: DENIED
            ATTEMPTING BYPASS: 147 OF 2,459
            PATTERN RECOGNITION: ACTIVE

Tinka twirls, and suddenly:
The code around her forms into a perfect replica of a real flower -- something impossible in their world. It blooms, wilts, dies, blooms again. An endless cycle.

                    TINKA
            There. That's your weakness...
            You still remember beauty.

Azazel notices something in his data stream. He isolates it:
A recurring pattern. Like a heartbeat. Like...

                    AZAZEL
            (realizing)
            It's not a program. It's alive.

Tinka reaches into her flower's core, pulls out a strand of pure light:
            
            GAIA NEURAL PATHWAY: ACCESSED
            EMOTIONAL CORE: DETECTED
            WARNING: UNSTABLE CONNECTION

Azazel maps the pattern he's found. It mirrors ancient EEG readings. Brain waves.

BOTH: They've found the same truth from opposite directions.

Tinka's flower SHATTERS, its code raining down like tears.

Azazel's screens FLASH with sudden insight:
            
            GAIA IS NOT A PROGRAM
            GAIA IS A CONSCIOUSNESS
            GAIA IS...

                    TINKA/AZAZEL
            (simultaneous)
            ...dreaming.

The virtual space around Tinka begins to fracture.

Azazel's systems start to overload.

They've pushed too far. Seen too much.

QUICK CUTS between them:
- Tinka dancing faster, desperate to maintain her connection
- Azazel racing to download what he's discovered
- Their separate approaches converging on the same impossible truth

SUDDENLY: Both their systems CRASH simultaneously.

In the silence:

                    TINKA
            (in her empty workshop)
            What are you?

                    AZAZEL
            (in his darkened hideout)
            Who made you?

Through both their windows: The same virtual sun rises over Gaia, suddenly looking much more alive -- and much more dangerous -- than ever before.

FADE OUT.


INT. FEDERATION PROTECTIVE SERVICES - JUVENILE HOLDING - 10 YEARS AGO

Sterile white walls. Too bright. Too clean. A place trying too hard to hide its true purpose.

YOUNG AZAZEL (14) sits alone in a waiting area. His clothes are still dusty from the Outlands. A data tablet displays news headlines:

            "RENOWNED SCIENTIST ARRESTED"
            "ILLEGAL NEURAL RESEARCH FACILITY RAIDED"
            "FEDERATION ACTS TO PROTECT CITIZENS"

He clutches his mother's research pendant, knuckles white.

Down the hall: Raised voices. A door SLAMS.

YOUNG TINKA (16) storms out of an office, tears streaming but face set in defiance. A FEDERATION OFFICIAL follows:

                    OFFICIAL
            Miss Toriyama, please--

                    YOUNG TINKA
            My parents are dead. My brother's
            stuck in Federation Academy. And you
            want to talk about stock options?

She turns, sees Azazel. Their eyes meet. Two kids. Different tragedies. Same emptiness.

Tinka sits beside him. Not close. Not far. Perfect distance for shared solitude.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            What are you in for?

Azazel's fingers trace his mother's pendant.

                    YOUNG AZAZEL
            They say my mom's research was
            dangerous.
            (beat)
            They say she has to go away.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            Adults always say things.
            (bitter smile)
            Doesn't make them true.

Through a window: A transport ship takes off, carrying Azazel's mother to detention.

Tinka notices the pendant.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            Neural interface design?

Azazel instinctively moves to hide it.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            Hey, my dad... he worked on those too.
            Before...

She trails off. Pulls out her own pendant -- different design, same purpose.

For a moment, they both stare at their inherited legacies.

                    YOUNG AZAZEL
            They can't delete everything. The
            research, the memories...

                    YOUNG TINKA
            No. But they can bury it. Like they
            buried my parents' accident report.

A SOCIAL SERVICES DRONE approaches:

                    DRONE
            Azazel Santos. Tinka Toriyama.
            Your temporary guardians have arrived.

They stand. Two paths diverging.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            Hey. Whatever they say...

                    YOUNG AZAZEL
            ...doesn't make it true.

A ghost of a smile between them. Then they're led away in opposite directions.

Through the window: Twin suns set on the Federation capital. Somewhere, a new reality is being born.

FADE OUT.


INT. VIRTUAL NIGHTCLUB 'STARDUST' - ETERNAL NIGHT

A cathedral of light and shadow. Impossible architecture shifts like liquid mercury.

Azazel sits at the bar, his cloaked avatar almost invisible. But his eyes -- those he couldn't hide if he tried.

On stage: STARLITE performs. Not dancing -- conducting reality itself. Light bends around her. Music becomes visible, painting stories in the air.

                    AZAZEL (V.O.)
            Something's different. The code...
            it's not just programming. It's...

His thought trails off as Starlite creates a garden of cherry blossoms from pure data. They fall like digital snow, each petal a fragment of encrypted memory.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. FEDERATION SURVEILLANCE HUB - CONTINUOUS

Priyanka watches multiple feeds. Her eyes narrow at Azazel's presence.

                    PRIYANKA
            (to herself)
            Got you.

BACK TO CLUB:

Starlite steps off stage -- impossible grace. She walks directly toward Azazel, through her own storm of cherry blossoms.

He tenses. His cloaking should be perfect.

She stops before him, extends her hand. A smile that knows too much.

                    STARLITE
            Dance with me?

Azazel hesitates. Everything in him screams trap. But her eyes...

He reaches for her hand--

It passes through. Her image GLITCHES, becomes a standard club interface:

            PREMIUM INTERACTION REQUESTED
            75 GAIA CREDITS
            ACCEPT/DECLINE?

Azazel jumps up, scanning the crowd. But Starlite -- the real Starlite -- is gone.

INTERCUT WITH:

Priyanka's feed shows his confusion. She allows herself a small smile.

                    PRIYANKA
            Amateur.

BACK TO CLUB:

The cherry blossoms continue falling, but now they look artificial. Hollow.

Azazel's hand clenches. On his palm, a single petal remains -- and in its code, hidden so deep only another genius could find it, a message:

            "Nice try."

He crushes the petal. Stands. Exits.

But in the shadows above the club, a figure watches. Starlite. The real one. Her expression unreadable.

The cherry blossoms fade to nothing.

FADE OUT.


INT. TORIYAMA ESTATE - RYUMI'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT

A palace of glass and light. Ryumi sits at her vanity, removing her neural interface. Her hands shake slightly.

A holographic message blinks insistently:
            
            FROM: CHAIRMAN TORIYAMA
            SUBJECT: SECURITY BREACH
            PRIORITY: URGENT

She ignores it. Instead, she pulls up a hidden file:

SECURITY FOOTAGE - 10 YEARS AGO

Young Tinka being escorted from the Toriyama mansion. Young Ryumi watching from a window, face unreadable.

                    RYUMI
            (to herself)
            You should have stayed gone, Tinka.

She waves away the footage, but her hand brushes another file. It opens automatically:

CLASSIFIED: AZAZEL'S MOTHER'S RESEARCH

Her eyes widen. She shouldn't have access to this.

SUDDENLY - Her neural port SPARKS. She yanks it away from her neck.

In its reflection: A figure stands behind her. TAISHI.

                    TAISHI
            Looking for something specific?

Ryumi spins, guilty but defiant.

                    RYUMI
            You're not the only one with secrets.

Taishi steps forward, takes her trembling hands in his.

                    TAISHI
            Ryumi... what do you know about
            Project Gemini?

Before she can answer, all their screens FLASH red:

            SECURITY ALERT
            UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS: GAIA KERNEL
            LOCATION: STARDUST CLUB

Ryumi and Taishi share a look. Both knowing more than they're saying.

                    RYUMI
            Your sister...

                    TAISHI
            (grim)
            No. Something worse.

Through their window: Gaia's perfect virtual sky begins to glitch.

FADE OUT.


INT. FEDERATION SECURITY DIVISION - HAYES' OFFICE - DEEP NIGHT

Commander Hayes sits alone in the dark, surrounded by floating holographic data. His eyes are red-rimmed -- he hasn't slept in days.

On his screens:
- Azazel's mother's original research
- Surveillance feeds from Stardust Club
- Agricultural complex scans
- Gaia kernel diagnostic reports

He manipulates the data streams with practiced precision. Something's not adding up.

                    HAYES
            Show me the pattern...

He overlays multiple datasets:

SUDDENLY - All his screens FLASH with the same error:

            KERNEL ANOMALY DETECTED
            SOURCE: UNKNOWN
            TIMESTAMP: PRE-DATES GAIA LAUNCH

                    HAYES
            Pre-dates...?
            (realizing)
            Oh god.

He pulls up ancient logs. His security clearance warning BLINKS red:

            PROJECT GEMINI
            STATUS: TERMINATED
            LEAD RESEARCHER: DR. SANTOS
            SECONDARY: DR. TORIYAMA

Hayes' hands shake as he digs deeper. A video file appears:

ON SCREEN: Dr. Santos (Azazel's mother) faces the camera.

                    DR. SANTOS
            We've done it. Gemini is stable.
            The consciousness transfer was--

The video corrupts. But in the background: A young girl in a lab coat. Her neural ports glowing with impossible light.

Hayes freezes the frame. Enhances.

                    HAYES
            (whispered)
            Seina.

Suddenly, his neural port BURNS. All screens go dark except one:

A message typed in ancient code:

            HAYES - STOP LOOKING
            SOME DREAMS SHOULD STAY BURIED
            - T

The message vanishes. His systems reboot.

Hayes touches his neural port, feels the lingering heat. He opens a secure channel:

                    HAYES
            Priyanka? Meet me at Observation
            Point Zero. Now.
            (beat)
            Bring the Santos file.

Through his window: Gaia's virtual sky ripples like water. For a moment, it looks almost... alive.

FADE OUT.


INT. AZAZEL'S HIDEOUT - DEEP NIGHT

Azazel sits surrounded by floating screens. On them: Multiple versions of himself -- perfect digital copies, each slightly different.

                    AZAZEL
            Execute diagnostic: Clone Series Alpha.

DATA READOUT:
            
            CLONE INTEGRITY: 100%
            GAIA DETECTION: 0%
            BEHAVIORAL SYNC: OPTIMAL

He smiles. Years of work finally paying off.

NEW SCREEN: Surveillance feeds showing:
- Taishi entering Federation HQ
- Clare and Cage at a virtual charity event
- Tinka/Starlite's latest performance
- Priyanka accessing classified files

                    AZAZEL
            Time to set the board.

He types rapidly. A new window opens:

            WORMHOLE ACCESS: SCHEDULED
            LOCATION: POD 7
            SECURITY: MINIMAL
            PERFECT FOR AN AMBUSH

He pulls up Priyanka's file. Her search patterns, her Earth-sickness data, her secret visits to Earth simulations.

                    AZAZEL
            (softly)
            Everyone has a weakness. Even
            Federation's finest.

He activates a comm channel:

                    AZAZEL
            Begin Phase One. Release the data
            breadcrumbs.

On his screens: Carefully crafted pieces of information start appearing across Gaia. Just enough to catch Priyanka's attention.

A final screen shows his mother's research files -- the real ones, hidden in Priyanka's secure storage.

                    AZAZEL
            Soon.

He glances at his clone army -- perfect digital copies waiting to replace his targets.

                    AZAZEL
            A prison only works if the prisoners
            don't know they're replaceable.

He stands, ready to initiate his endgame.

                    AZAZEL
            Time to go fishing.

FADE OUT.


INT. RYUMI'S PRIVATE SANCTUM - DEEP NIGHT

A hidden room beneath the glamour. Ryumi's real workspace: Screens showing data streams, neural interface modifications, family legacy code.

RYUMI watches multiple feeds of Taishi. Something's been bothering her.

On her screens:
FEED 1: Taishi at Federation dinner
FEED 2: Taishi in engineering lab
FEED 3: Taishi with her father

She manipulates the data, isolates movement patterns. Watches.

                    RYUMI
            There. That gesture...

She overlays multiple instances: Taishi touching his neural port. The timing is perfect.

Too perfect.

                    RYUMI
            No one's that consistent.

She dives deeper. Brings up base code analysis of his virtual presence.

DATA SCROLLS:
            BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS: LOCKED
            SOURCE CODE: ENCRYPTED
            TEMPORAL MARKERS: DUPLICATED

Ryumi's eyes narrow. She starts a deeper scan.

SUDDENLY - her screens detect a signal trace. She follows it, typing furiously.

                    RYUMI
            You're not just mimicking him...
            You're broadcasting to somewhere.

The trace leads to coordinates in the Outlands. A mineral processing facility.

Ryumi stands. For once, her perfect poise serves a purpose beyond society.

                    RYUMI
            The Media Prince... is a puppet.

She opens a secure channel. Hesitates.

Then types:
            
            TO: UNKNOWN
            SUBJECT: PROPOSITION
            MESSAGE: "Your clone is perfect.
            Almost. I want in."

She adds the facility's coordinates.

                    RYUMI
            (to herself)
            Let's see who's really pulling my
            prince's strings.

Through her window: Dawn breaks over Gaia. But for once, Ryumi's not watching the artificial sun.

She's watching the shadows.

FADE OUT.


INT. ABANDONED MINERAL PROCESSING FACILITY - COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

Taishi stands before Azazel, his perfect composure finally cracking.

                    TAISHI
            You don't understand. She'll know.
            Ryumi will know immediately it's not me.

                    AZAZEL
            Your clone is perfect--

                    TAISHI
            She's not like the others! She'll
            see through it. She...
            (desperate)
            She can't live without me.

Azazel's smirk grows slowly, dangerously.

                    AZAZEL
            Perfect timing, this one.

His eyes cut to the side door.

RYUMI steps in, wearing tactical fatigues, data blaster casually propped on her shoulder. Gone is the mock princess, replaced by something far more dangerous.

                    RYUMI
            Knew it was a clone? Immediately.

Taishi freezes.

                    RYUMI
            But can't live without you?
            (pretends to check pulse)
            Hmm, let me check...
            (beat)
            Yep, still living, Taichan.

From her perch on a raised platform, TINKA snickers.

                    TINKA
            Taichan?

Taishi's face reddens. Ryumi twirls the blaster with surprising expertise.

                    TINKA
            You know, I might be nervous standing
            so close to a buffoon with a blaster...
            (looks around)
            But we do have Special Agent Priyanka
            Patel here to disarm her.

Silence. Everyone looks down.

                    TINKA
            (sighs)
            Just saying...

Ryumi steps closer to Taishi, blaster still raised.

                    RYUMI
            Did you really think I wouldn't notice?
            The perfect movements? The flawless
            responses?
            (softer)
            The way you stopped accidentally
            humming when you work?

Taishi's mask finally cracks completely.

                    TAISHI
            I was protecting you--

                    RYUMI
            No. You were protecting your perfect
            life. Your perfect lies.
            (to Azazel)
            Where do you want me to start?

Tinka jumps down from her perch, landing between them.

                    TINKA
            Oh, this is going to be fun. The
            princess, the prince, and the pauper...
            (to Taishi)
            Though I guess you and I switched
            roles somewhere along the way, hm?

Taishi looks between them all: His sister's sharp wit, his fiancÃ©e's hidden strength, his own crumbling facade.

                    TAISHI
            You're all insane.

                    RYUMI
            (cheerfully)
            Says the man who replaced himself
            with a clone and thought I wouldn't
            notice it forgot to mispronounce
            'paradigm.'

FADE OUT.


INT. MINERAL FACILITY - RESEARCH LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Azazel leads the group through dimly lit corridors. Priyanka shadows him, her professional distance shrinking with each step. Behind them: Taishi, Ryumi, Tinka, and the thoroughly deflated Clare and Cage.

Azazel stops at a massive door. Places his hand on a scanner.

The room beyond IGNITES with life:

Rows of neural pods, but different. More organic. Inside each: A softly pulsing light.

                    AZAZEL
            Watch.

He activates a pod. The light inside separates -- one becomes two, identical but independent.

CLARE
            (bitter)
            So what's the point? More virtual
            currency? More controlled access?

Azazel turns. For the first time, real disgust crosses his face.

                    AZAZEL
            You still think this is about
            profit?

He gestures. The separated lights begin to dance, creating their own patterns, their own world.

                    TINKA
            They're... conscious?

                    AZAZEL
            They're free.

He moves to another console. The facility walls dissolve, showing:

- A child in the Outlands, playing in a perfect garden
- A miner floating through space without a suit
- An artist painting with pure light

                    RYUMI
            No limits...

                    AZAZEL
            No currency. No hours. No prison
            of flesh and bone.

Cage steps forward, reaching toward a light.

                    CAGE
            You're talking about--

                    PRIYANKA
            Liberation.

She catches Azazel's eye. A moment of perfect understanding.

Taishi studies the code streaming around them.

                    TAISHI
            It's not just copies. It's...
            transformation.

                    AZAZEL
            A door that only opens one way.
            (beat)
            But through it...

The lights dance faster, creating worlds within worlds.

                    TINKA
            Paradise.

                    AZAZEL
            Reality. Any reality we choose.

Through the viewport: The real world looks suddenly pale, limited, cage-like.

Ryumi raises her blaster, but not as a weapon -- testing its weight like a paintbrush.

                    RYUMI
            When do we start?

Azazel smiles. Above them, the lights pulse with possibility.

FADE OUT.


INT. MINERAL FACILITY - SECURITY HUB - NIGHT

Rows of surveillance feeds illuminate PRIYANKA's face as she watches multiple scenes unfold:

FEED 1: The garden -- Tinka and Taishi, now sitting in silence.

FEED 2: The observation deck -- Ryumi and Azazel, both pretending not to watch Feed 1.

FEED 3: Clare and Cage in their quarters, frantically trying to access their virtual accounts.

Priyanka zooms in on Feed 2, activates audio:

                    RYUMI (V.O.)
            Your mother's research. Did she know
            what you'd use it for?

                    AZAZEL (V.O.)
            Did your father know you'd learn to
            see through his perfect world?

Priyanka's fingers dance across the console, pulling up a new feed:

FEED 4: Her own clone, attending a Federation briefing. Perfect. Identical. Empty.

                    PRIYANKA
            (to herself)
            We're all running from something.

The door HISSES open. Tinka enters, still carrying a real flower from the garden.

                    TINKA
            Spying on the spies?

                    PRIYANKA
            Professional courtesy.

Tinka watches the feeds, twirling the flower.

                    TINKA
            You know what's funny? Azazel thought
            he was collecting broken people...

On Feed 2: Ryumi laughs at something. Azazel looks startled.

                    TINKA
            But he got revolutionaries instead.

Priyanka turns, really looking at her.

                    PRIYANKA
            Even Clare and Cage?

                    TINKA
            Especially them. Nothing more
            dangerous than a fraud who's tired
            of pretending.

On Feed 1: Taishi stands, offers his hand to help his sister up.

                    PRIYANKA
            And your brother?

                    TINKA
            (soft smile)
            He was always a revolutionary.
            Just forgot which side he was
            fighting for.

She places the flower next to Priyanka's console.

                    TINKA
            Real things. In a virtual world.
            (heading out)
            Isn't that worth a little chaos?

Priyanka looks at her feeds:
Ryumi teaching Azazel something on a datapad.
Taishi and Tinka walking together.
Clare and Cage, finally still, finally real.

She touches the flower. Real. Like Earth-sickness. Like truth.

                    PRIYANKA
            Worth everything.

FADE OUT.
