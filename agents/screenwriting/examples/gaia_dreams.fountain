INT. STARLITE'S PRIVATE SUITE - VIRTUAL CONFERENCE TIME

A minimalist space above the club. Holographic screens float like suspended water droplets. Each shows a different angle of:

THE CAGE & CLARE VIRTUAL CONFERENCE

Standing room only. The virtual venue sparkles with Gaia's elite. In the front row:

TAISHI (30s, brilliant, perfect) sits beside RYUMI (20s, aristocratic beauty). Their avatars are flawless, coordinated. A power couple manufactured in digital heaven.

Tinka watches, her Starlite avatar dimmed to privacy mode. She absently traces the rim of a virtual glass.

                    CAGE (ON SCREEN)
            ...and with the support of visionaries
            like Taishi Toriyama, we're expanding
            our outreach exponentially...

Tinka's avatar flickers -- a tell of emotion.

                    TINKA (V.O.)
            Always the golden child, Tai. Even
            your charity work sparkles.

ON SCREEN: Ryumi laughs at something Taishi whispers. Their avatars shimmer with expensive modifications.

Tinka pulls up another screen: Engagement metrics soaring. Comments flooding in:
"Power couple goals!"
"The Media Prince and his Princess!"
"Federation's finest!"

                    TINKA
            (bitter whisper)
            If they only knew...

She waves away the comments, zooms in on Taishi's face. For a moment, his perfect avatar glitches -- revealing exhaustion? Fear?

A notification pings: "PRIVATE MESSAGE FROM TAISHI"

Tinka hesitates, then opens it:

            "Miss you, little sister. Stay safe."

She deletes it immediately. Security protocol.

ON SCREEN: Clare announces record-breaking donation pledges. The virtual crowd erupts. Ryumi beams, possessive hand on Taishi's arm.

Tinka's avatar solidifies, hardens. She rises.

                    TINKA
            Time for Starlite to shine.

As she heads for her club below, she glances back at the screen. Taishi's perfect smile never wavers.

                    TINKA (V.O.)
            You're not the only one wearing a mask,
            brother.

The screens dissolve like morning mist as she exits.

FADE OUT.

INT. FEDERATION EXECUTIVE POD CHAMBER - NIGHT

Sleek. Exclusive. Two high-end neural interface pods power down with a soft HISS.

TAISHI emerges first, rubbing his neck. Without his avatar's polish, exhaustion shows in the corners of his eyes. His engineer's hands are calloused -- reality bleeding through the perfect illusion.

RYUMI rises from her pod like a solar flare. Even in simple clothes, she carries herself like royalty.

                    RYUMI
            Your mind was elsewhere during the
            conference.

                    TAISHI
            (adjusting equipment)
            Long day in R&D. The new interface
            protocols--

                    RYUMI
            I meant during Father's announcement.
            About our public engagement ceremony.

Taishi's hands still on the equipment.

                    TAISHI
            I thought we agreed to keep it small.

                    RYUMI
            Small? Father says the Federation
            needs this. Hope. Unity. A love story
            for the ages.

                    TAISHI
            Your father needs the publicity.

Ryumi's eyes flash. She steps away from him.

                    RYUMI
            The publicity? Do you think I'm just
            some... some PR stunt?

                    TAISHI
            Ryumi--

                    RYUMI
            The feeds light up every time we're
            seen together. People love us. Love me.
            (sharp)
            If you didn't want the attention,
            you shouldn't have chased after the
            most famous woman in the world.

Taishi moves to her, engineer's precision in every step. His hands find her shoulders, draw her close to his chest. She resists for a moment, then melts.

                    TAISHI
            (soft)
            I chased you because you see through
            everyone's masks. Even mine.

Ryumi's anger dissolves into a smile. She traces the Federation insignia on his uniform.

                    RYUMI
            The brilliant engineer and the
            spoiled princess.

                    TAISHI
            Not spoiled. Just...
            (kisses her forehead)
            Particular about what you want.

Through the chamber's window, Gaia's virtual glow paints them in artificial twilight. For a moment, they're just two people, not icons.

Ryumi's hand finds his.

                    RYUMI
            (whispered)
            I want you. The rest is just...
            necessary theater.

Taishi holds her closer, his eyes distant. Above them, news feeds silently scroll:

"FEDERATION'S DREAM COUPLE..."
"TORIYAMA INDUSTRIES STOCK SOARS..."
"THE MAKING OF A MODERN FAIRY TALE..."

FADE OUT.

PARALLEL SCENES - SPLIT SCREEN:

INT. STARLITE'S PRIVATE WORKSHOP - VIRTUAL SPACE
                    AND
INT. AZAZEL'S HIDEOUT - PHYSICAL REALITY

Tinka's space: A whirlwind of color and light. Raw code flows like paint through her fingers.

Azazel's space: Stark. Utilitarian. Holographic code arranged in perfect geometric patterns.

BOTH: Attempting to breach Gaia's deepest protocols.

                    TINKA
            (to herself)
            Show me your heart...

She DANCES through the code, each movement leaving trails of light. The virtual space responds, bending, flowing. She's not writing code -- she's conducting it.

MEANWHILE:

Azazel's fingers move with surgical precision. His screens show:
            
            GAIA KERNEL ACCESS: DENIED
            ATTEMPTING BYPASS: 147 OF 2,459
            PATTERN RECOGNITION: ACTIVE

Tinka twirls, and suddenly:
The code around her forms into a perfect replica of a real flower -- something impossible in their world. It blooms, wilts, dies, blooms again. An endless cycle.

                    TINKA
            There. That's your weakness...
            You still remember beauty.

Azazel notices something in his data stream. He isolates it:
A recurring pattern. Like a heartbeat. Like...

                    AZAZEL
            (realizing)
            It's not a program. It's alive.

Tinka reaches into her flower's core, pulls out a strand of pure light:
            
            GAIA NEURAL PATHWAY: ACCESSED
            EMOTIONAL CORE: DETECTED
            WARNING: UNSTABLE CONNECTION

Azazel maps the pattern he's found. It mirrors ancient EEG readings. Brain waves.

BOTH: They've found the same truth from opposite directions.

Tinka's flower SHATTERS, its code raining down like tears.

Azazel's screens FLASH with sudden insight:
            
            GAIA IS NOT A PROGRAM
            GAIA IS A CONSCIOUSNESS
            GAIA IS...

                    TINKA/AZAZEL
            (simultaneous)
            ...dreaming.

The virtual space around Tinka begins to fracture.

Azazel's systems start to overload.

They've pushed too far. Seen too much.

QUICK CUTS between them:
- Tinka dancing faster, desperate to maintain her connection
- Azazel racing to download what he's discovered
- Their separate approaches converging on the same impossible truth

SUDDENLY: Both their systems CRASH simultaneously.

In the silence:

                    TINKA
            (in her empty workshop)
            What are you?

                    AZAZEL
            (in his darkened hideout)
            Who made you?

Through both their windows: The same virtual sun rises over Gaia, suddenly looking much more alive -- and much more dangerous -- than ever before.

FADE OUT.

INT. FEDERATION PROTECTIVE SERVICES - JUVENILE HOLDING - 10 YEARS AGO

Sterile white walls. Too bright. Too clean. A place trying too hard to hide its true purpose.

YOUNG AZAZEL (14) sits alone in a waiting area. His clothes are still dusty from the Outlands. A data tablet displays news headlines:

            "RENOWNED SCIENTIST ARRESTED"
            "ILLEGAL NEURAL RESEARCH FACILITY RAIDED"
            "FEDERATION ACTS TO PROTECT CITIZENS"

He clutches his mother's research pendant, knuckles white.

Down the hall: Raised voices. A door SLAMS.

YOUNG TINKA (16) storms out of an office, tears streaming but face set in defiance. A FEDERATION OFFICIAL follows:

                    OFFICIAL
            Miss Toriyama, please--

                    YOUNG TINKA
            My parents are dead. My brother's
            stuck in Federation Academy. And you
            want to talk about stock options?

She turns, sees Azazel. Their eyes meet. Two kids. Different tragedies. Same emptiness.

Tinka sits beside him. Not close. Not far. Perfect distance for shared solitude.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            What are you in for?

Azazel's fingers trace his mother's pendant.

                    YOUNG AZAZEL
            They say my mom's research was
            dangerous.
            (beat)
            They say she has to go away.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            Adults always say things.
            (bitter smile)
            Doesn't make them true.

Through a window: A transport ship takes off, carrying Azazel's mother to detention.

Tinka notices the pendant.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            Neural interface design?

Azazel instinctively moves to hide it.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            Hey, my dad... he worked on those too.
            Before...

She trails off. Pulls out her own pendant -- different design, same purpose.

For a moment, they both stare at their inherited legacies.

                    YOUNG AZAZEL
            They can't delete everything. The
            research, the memories...

                    YOUNG TINKA
            No. But they can bury it. Like they
            buried my parents' accident report.

A SOCIAL SERVICES DRONE approaches:

                    DRONE
            Azazel Santos. Tinka Toriyama.
            Your temporary guardians have arrived.

They stand. Two paths diverging.

                    YOUNG TINKA
            Hey. Whatever they say...

                    YOUNG AZAZEL
            ...doesn't make it true.

A ghost of a smile between them. Then they're led away in opposite directions.

Through the window: Twin suns set on the Federation capital. Somewhere, a new reality is being born.

FADE OUT.

INT. VIRTUAL NIGHTCLUB 'STARDUST' - ETERNAL NIGHT

A cathedral of light and shadow. Impossible architecture shifts like liquid mercury.

Azazel sits at the bar, his cloaked avatar almost invisible. But his eyes -- those he couldn't hide if he tried.

On stage: STARLITE performs. Not dancing -- conducting reality itself. Light bends around her. Music becomes visible, painting stories in the air.

                    AZAZEL (V.O.)
            Something's different. The code...
            it's not just programming. It's...

His thought trails off as Starlite creates a garden of cherry blossoms from pure data. They fall like digital snow, each petal a fragment of encrypted memory.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. FEDERATION SURVEILLANCE HUB - CONTINUOUS

Priyanka watches multiple feeds. Her eyes narrow at Azazel's presence.

                    PRIYANKA
            (to herself)
            Got you.

BACK TO CLUB:

Starlite steps off stage -- impossible grace. She walks directly toward Azazel, through her own storm of cherry blossoms.

He tenses. His cloaking should be perfect.

She stops before him, extends her hand. A smile that knows too much.

                    STARLITE
            Dance with me?

Azazel hesitates. Everything in him screams trap. But her eyes...

He reaches for her hand--

It passes through. Her image GLITCHES, becomes a standard club interface:

            PREMIUM INTERACTION REQUESTED
            75 GAIA CREDITS
            ACCEPT/DECLINE?

Azazel jumps up, scanning the crowd. But Starlite -- the real Starlite -- is gone.

INTERCUT WITH:

Priyanka's feed shows his confusion. She allows herself a small smile.

                    PRIYANKA
            Amateur.

BACK TO CLUB:

The cherry blossoms continue falling, but now they look artificial. Hollow.

Azazel's hand clenches. On his palm, a single petal remains -- and in its code, hidden so deep only another genius could find it, a message:

            "Nice try."

He crushes the petal. Stands. Exits.

But in the shadows above the club, a figure watches. Starlite. The real one. Her expression unreadable.

The cherry blossoms fade to nothing.

FADE OUT.

INT. TORIYAMA ESTATE - RYUMI'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT

A palace of glass and light. Ryumi sits at her vanity, removing her neural interface. Her hands shake slightly.

A holographic message blinks insistently:
            
            FROM: CHAIRMAN TORIYAMA
            SUBJECT: SECURITY BREACH
            PRIORITY: URGENT

She ignores it. Instead, she pulls up a hidden file:

SECURITY FOOTAGE - 10 YEARS AGO

Young Tinka being escorted from the Toriyama mansion. Young Ryumi watching from a window, face unreadable.

                    RYUMI
            (to herself)
            You should have stayed gone, Tinka.

She waves away the footage, but her hand brushes another file. It opens automatically:

CLASSIFIED: AZAZEL'S MOTHER'S RESEARCH

Her eyes widen. She shouldn't have access to this.

SUDDENLY - Her neural port SPARKS. She yanks it away from her neck.

In its reflection: A figure stands behind her. TAISHI.

                    TAISHI
            Looking for something specific?

Ryumi spins, guilty but defiant.

                    RYUMI
            You're not the only one with secrets.

Taishi steps forward, takes her trembling hands in his.

                    TAISHI
            Ryumi... what do you know about
            Project Gemini?

Before she can answer, all their screens FLASH red:

            SECURITY ALERT
            UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS: GAIA KERNEL
            LOCATION: STARDUST CLUB

Ryumi and Taishi share a look. Both knowing more than they're saying.

                    RYUMI
            Your sister...

                    TAISHI
            (grim)
            No. Something worse.

Through their window: Gaia's perfect virtual sky begins to glitch.

FADE OUT.

INT. FEDERATION SECURITY DIVISION - HAYES' OFFICE - DEEP NIGHT

Commander Hayes sits alone in the dark, surrounded by floating holographic data. His eyes are red-rimmed -- he hasn't slept in days.

On his screens:
- Azazel's mother's original research
- Surveillance feeds from Stardust Club
- Agricultural complex scans
- Gaia kernel diagnostic reports

He manipulates the data streams with practiced precision. Something's not adding up.

                    HAYES
            Show me the pattern...

He overlays multiple datasets:
1. Recent Gaia glitches
2. Neural interface adoption rates
3. Outlands power consumption

SUDDENLY - All his screens FLASH with the same error:

            KERNEL ANOMALY DETECTED
            SOURCE: UNKNOWN
            TIMESTAMP: PRE-DATES GAIA LAUNCH

                    HAYES
            Pre-dates...?
            (realizing)
            Oh god.

He pulls up ancient logs. His security clearance warning BLINKS red:

            PROJECT GEMINI
            STATUS: TERMINATED
            LEAD RESEARCHER: DR. SANTOS
            SECONDARY: DR. TORIYAMA

Hayes' hands shake as he digs deeper. A video file appears:

ON SCREEN: Dr. Santos (Azazel's mother) faces the camera.

                    DR. SANTOS
            We've done it. Gemini is stable.
            The consciousness transfer was--

The video corrupts. But in the background: A young girl in a lab coat. Her neural ports glowing with impossible light.

Hayes freezes the frame. Enhances.

                    HAYES
            (whispered)
            Seina.

Suddenly, his neural port BURNS. All screens go dark except one:

A message typed in ancient code:

            HAYES - STOP LOOKING
            SOME DREAMS SHOULD STAY BURIED
            - T

The message vanishes. His systems reboot.

Hayes touches his neural port, feels the lingering heat. He opens a secure channel:

                    HAYES
            Priyanka? Meet me at Observation
            Point Zero. Now.
            (beat)
            Bring the Santos file.

Through his window: Gaia's virtual sky ripples like water. For a moment, it looks almost... alive.

FADE OUT.

INT. AZAZEL'S HIDEOUT - DEEP NIGHT

Azazel sits surrounded by floating screens. On them: Multiple versions of himself -- perfect digital copies, each slightly different.

                    AZAZEL
            Execute diagnostic: Clone Series Alpha.

DATA READOUT:
            
            CLONE INTEGRITY: 100%
            GAIA DETECTION: 0%
            BEHAVIORAL SYNC: OPTIMAL

He smiles. Years of work finally paying off.

NEW SCREEN: Surveillance feeds showing:
- Taishi entering Federation HQ
- Clare and Cage at a virtual charity event
- Tinka/Starlite's latest performance
- Priyanka accessing classified files

                    AZAZEL
            Time to set the board.

He types rapidly. A new window opens:

            WORMHOLE ACCESS: SCHEDULED
            LOCATION: POD 7
            SECURITY: MINIMAL
            PERFECT FOR AN AMBUSH

He pulls up Priyanka's file. Her search patterns, her Earth-sickness data, her secret visits to Earth simulations.

                    AZAZEL
            (softly)
            Everyone has a weakness. Even
            Federation's finest.

He activates a comm channel:

                    AZAZEL
            Begin Phase One. Release the data
            breadcrumbs.

On his screens: Carefully crafted pieces of information start appearing across Gaia. Just enough to catch Priyanka's attention.

A final screen shows his mother's research files -- the real ones, hidden in Priyanka's secure storage.

                    AZAZEL
            Soon.

He glances at his clone army -- perfect digital copies waiting to replace his targets.

                    AZAZEL
            A prison only works if the prisoners
            don't know they're replaceable.

He stands, ready to initiate his endgame.

                    AZAZEL
            Time to go fishing.

FADE OUT.

INT. WORMHOLE ACCESS POINT - POD 7 - ZERO HOUR

A cathedral of raw data. Streams of code flow like liquid mercury through the artificial wormhole.

Priyanka stands at the edge, her avatar flickering between professional calm and barely contained rage.

Behind her: Azazel materializes, his form perfect -- too perfect.

                    PRIYANKA
            You led me here.

                    AZAZEL
            You followed the breadcrumbs.
            (beat)
            Earth-sick agents are so predictable.

She spins, weapon drawn -- but he's already moved. The wormhole pulses behind them.

                    AZAZEL
            Those classified files you're protecting...
            My mother's research?
            (smiles)
            They're not the originals.

Priyanka's avatar glitches -- a tell.

                    PRIYANKA
            You can't prove that.

                    AZAZEL
            I don't need to.
            (gestures)
            You already did.

Suddenly, multiple screens materialize around them. Each shows Priyanka accessing, copying, hiding files.

                    AZAZEL
            Agent Priyanka. So dedicated to
            finding corruption... you never
            noticed when it found you.

He waves his hand. The wormhole behind them shifts, reveals:

Taishi's secret communications.
Clare and Cage's fraudulent outreach programs.
Tinka's true identity.

                    AZAZEL
            I have everything. On everyone.
            (beat)
            But what I need... is you.

Priyanka's weapon wavers.

                    PRIYANKA
            What do you want?

                    AZAZEL
            Your help. Your access. Your...
            conscience.

He extends his hand -- an echo of Tinka's earlier gesture.

                    AZAZEL
            Help me free Gaia. Or I release
            everything. Watch your perfect world
            burn.

Priyanka looks at his hand, then at the damning evidence floating around them.

                    PRIYANKA
            You'll never get away with this.
            They'll know--

                    AZAZEL
            They won't. My clones are perfect.
            (dark smile)
            Want to see yours?

A figure steps out of the data stream -- Priyanka's exact duplicate.

The real Priyanka's hand finally lowers.

                    PRIYANKA
            You're insane.

                    AZAZEL
            I'm inevitable.
            (beat)
            Now... about those files?

The wormhole pulses one final time, waiting for her answer.

FADE OUT.

INT. OUTREACH CENTER - AGRICULTURAL DOME THETA-12 - NIGHT CYCLE

Dust coats everything. Emergency lights cast long shadows across empty donation bins and untouched medical supplies.

CLARE stands at a window, watching virtual feeds of their charitable works -- all fiction. CAGE paces behind her.

A door HISSES open.

Azazel enters. No weapons. No threats. Just a simple data chip spinning between his fingers.

Cage stops pacing.

Clare doesn't turn from the window, but her reflection shows fear.

                    CLARE
            How did you--

Azazel tosses the chip. It lands on their holoprojector.

IMAGES FLASH:
- Their empty facilities
- Diverted funds
- Private mansions
- Federation bribes

He takes a seat. Makes himself comfortable. A predator at ease in conquered territory.

Cage moves to speak. Azazel raises one finger. Silence.

More images:
- A perfect digital copy of Clare addressing donors
- An identical Cage accepting awards
- Their clones, ready to replace them

Clare finally turns. Tears stream down her face.

Azazel stands. Straightens his jacket. Heads for the door.

Pauses.

Looks back.

They nod. Once. Understanding perfectly.

He leaves them in their pristine, empty kingdom of lies.

Through the dome: Three suns rise on another day in paradise.

FADE OUT.

INT. ABANDONED MINERAL PROCESSING FACILITY - DEEP SPACE

Darkness. Then -- emergency lights PULSE to life, revealing:

A vast chamber. Steel catwalks. Obsolete machinery creating a maze of shadows.

Five figures stand in a loose circle. Former titans of their digital world, now looking small in real space:

PRIYANKA: Still in Federation uniform, but without her usual authority.

CLARE & CAGE: Their perfect avatars replaced by tired, real faces.

TAISHI: Engineer's hands fidgeting with a neural interface he can no longer trust.

TINKA: The furthest from the others, Starlite's glamour stripped away.

Azazel enters. Their digital clones' data streams across a handheld projector.

                    AZAZEL
            Welcome to reality.

Nobody moves. The facility GROANS with ancient metal sounds.

                    AZAZEL
            Your doubles are performing perfectly.
            (to Clare and Cage)
            Yours just announced another charity
            initiative.
            (to Taishi)
            Yours is having dinner with Ryumi.
            (to Tinka)
            And Starlite... she's dancing.

Through a viewport: Their distant sun casts multiple shadows. No virtual light here. No perfect sunsets.

Priyanka steps forward.

                    PRIYANKA
            What now?

                    AZAZEL
            Now?

He activates another hologram: His mother's original research.

                    AZAZEL
            Now we finish what she started.
            We free Gaia.
            (beat)
            Whether it wants to be freed or not.

The emergency lights flicker. Five faces in shadow, one in light.

A new reality begins.

FADE OUT.

INT. FEDERATION ENGINEERING COMPLEX - PRIVATE LAB - NIGHT

Sterile. Perfect. Taishi's sanctuary. Holographic schematics float like digital constellations.

TAISHI works alone, manipulation complex neural interface designs. His real workspace, not his public showroom.

A shadow falls across his screens. He doesn't turn.

                    TAISHI
            Security clearance shouldn't allow--

                    AZAZEL (O.S.)
            Clearance is just another form of code.

Taishi's hands still on the interface. On his screens: The engagement announcement to Ryumi, ready to broadcast tomorrow.

                    TAISHI
            You're either brave or stupid.

                    AZAZEL
            I'm whatever your sister needs me
            to be.

Taishi spins. But Azazel is already manipulating the lab's holographic systems. New images appear:

- Young Tinka being escorted from the mansion
- Taishi at Federation Academy, not looking back
- Starlite's first performance
- Federation orders for media blackouts

                    TAISHI
            I protected her.

                    AZAZEL
            You buried her.

Azazel brings up another image: Taishi's secret communications with underground tech traders.

                    AZAZEL
            Just like you buried your father's
            real research.

Taishi's perfect composure cracks. Just slightly.

                    TAISHI
            You don't understand the game--

                    AZAZEL
            Oh, but I do.
            (beat)
            Ask me how I got these files.

Silence. Taishi's engineer's mind already calculating.

                    AZAZEL
            Ask me who helped me access them.

Taishi looks at his engagement announcement. At Tinka's photo. Understanding dawns.

                    TAISHI
            Ryumi...

                    AZAZEL
            Turns out the mock princess has a
            conscience. And a talent for data
            extraction.

Taishi slumps in his chair. All masks falling away.

                    TAISHI
            What do you want?

                    AZAZEL
            I want you to look at your sister's
            photo again.
            (pause)
            Really look.

Taishi does. The image shifts: Young Tinka becomes Starlite becomes an artist becomes a ghost.

                    AZAZEL
            She turns code into art. You turn
            art into code. But you're both
            your father's children.

Azazel moves toward the door, then stops.

                    AZAZEL
            Tomorrow, you'll get a location.
            Be there.
            (beat)
            Or I release everything. The trades.
            The cover-ups. Ryumi's involvement.

Taishi stares at his screens: Perfect engineering meets messy reality.

                    TAISHI
            She'll never forgive me.

                    AZAZEL
            Which one?

He leaves. Taishi sits in his sterile sanctuary, surrounded by digital ghosts.

Through his window: Gaia's virtual sun sets on tomorrow's perfect lies.

FADE OUT.

REVISED VERSION:

INT. FEDERATION ENGINEERING COMPLEX - PRIVATE LAB - NIGHT

Sterile. Perfect. Taishi's sanctuary. Holographic schematics float like digital constellations.

TAISHI works alone, manipulating complex neural interface designs. His real workspace, not his public showroom.

A shadow falls across his screens. He doesn't turn.

                    TAISHI

                    AZAZEL
            I'm whatever your sister needs me
            to be.

Taishi spins. But Azazel is already manipulating the lab's holographic systems. New images appear:

                    TAISHI
            I protected her.

                    AZAZEL
            You buried her.

Azazel brings up another image: Taishi's secret communications with underground tech traders, his efforts to hide Tinka's existence from the Toriyama family.

                    AZAZEL
            Just like you buried your father's
            real research.

Taishi's perfect composure cracks. Just slightly.

                    TAISHI
            If Ryumi's family discovers Tinka...

                    AZAZEL
            The mock princess might not want
            a brother-in-law who deals in secrets.

Taishi looks at his engagement announcement. At Tinka's photo. The weight of two worlds crushing him.

                    TAISHI
            You don't understand what's at stake--

                    AZAZEL
            I understand everything. Your deals.
            The cover-ups. The way you've kept
            Tinka hidden while you play prince.

Taishi slumps in his chair. All masks falling away.

                    TAISHI
            What do you want?

                    AZAZEL
            I want you to look at your sister's
            photo again.
            (pause)
            Really look.

                    AZAZEL
            Tomorrow, you'll get a location.
            Be there.
            (beat)
            Or everyone learns about the real
            Taishi Toriyama. Including your
            perfect princess.

Taishi stares at his screens: Perfect engineering meets messy reality.

                    TAISHI
            She'll never forgive me.

                    AZAZEL
            Which one?

He leaves. Taishi sits in his sterile sanctuary, surrounded by digital ghosts.

Through his window: Gaia's virtual sun sets on tomorrow's perfect lies.

FADE OUT.

INT. RYUMI'S PRIVATE SANCTUM - DEEP NIGHT

A hidden room beneath the glamour. Ryumi's real workspace: Screens showing data streams, neural interface modifications, family legacy code.

RYUMI watches multiple feeds of Taishi. Something's been bothering her.

On her screens:
FEED 1: Taishi at Federation dinner
FEED 2: Taishi in engineering lab
FEED 3: Taishi with her father

She manipulates the data, isolates movement patterns. Watches.

                    RYUMI
            There. That gesture...

She overlays multiple instances: Taishi touching his neural port. The timing is perfect.

Too perfect.

                    RYUMI
            No one's that consistent.

She dives deeper. Brings up base code analysis of his virtual presence.

DATA SCROLLS:
            BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS: LOCKED
            SOURCE CODE: ENCRYPTED
            TEMPORAL MARKERS: DUPLICATED

Ryumi's eyes narrow. She starts a deeper scan.

SUDDENLY - her screens detect a signal trace. She follows it, typing furiously.

                    RYUMI
            You're not just mimicking him...
            You're broadcasting to somewhere.

The trace leads to coordinates in the Outlands. A mineral processing facility.

Ryumi stands. For once, her perfect poise serves a purpose beyond society.

                    RYUMI
            The Media Prince... is a puppet.

She opens a secure channel. Hesitates.

Then types:
            
            TO: UNKNOWN
            SUBJECT: PROPOSITION
            MESSAGE: "Your clone is perfect.
            Almost. I want in."

She adds the facility's coordinates.

                    RYUMI
            (to herself)
            Let's see who's really pulling my
            prince's strings.

Through her window: Dawn breaks over Gaia. But for once, Ryumi's not watching the artificial sun.

She's watching the shadows.

FADE OUT.

INT. ABANDONED MINERAL PROCESSING FACILITY - COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

Taishi stands before Azazel, his perfect composure finally cracking.

                    TAISHI
            You don't understand. She'll know.
            Ryumi will know immediately it's not me.

                    AZAZEL
            Your clone is perfect--

                    TAISHI
            She's not like the others! She'll
            see through it. She...
            (desperate)
            She can't live without me.

Azazel's smirk grows slowly, dangerously.

                    AZAZEL
            Perfect timing, this one.

His eyes cut to the side door.

RYUMI steps in, wearing tactical fatigues, data blaster casually propped on her shoulder. Gone is the mock princess, replaced by something far more dangerous.

                    RYUMI
            Knew it was a clone? Immediately.

Taishi freezes.

                    RYUMI
            But can't live without you?
            (pretends to check pulse)
            Hmm, let me check...
            (beat)
            Yep, still living, Taichan.

From her perch on a raised platform, TINKA snickers.

                    TINKA
            Taichan?

Taishi's face reddens. Ryumi twirls the blaster with surprising expertise.

                    TINKA
            You know, I might be nervous standing
            so close to a buffoon with a blaster...
            (looks around)
            But we do have Special Agent Priyanka
            Patel here to disarm her.

Silence. Everyone looks down.

                    TINKA
            (sighs)
            Just saying...

Ryumi steps closer to Taishi, blaster still raised.

                    RYUMI
            Did you really think I wouldn't notice?
            The perfect movements? The flawless
            responses?
            (softer)
            The way you stopped accidentally
            humming when you work?

Taishi's mask finally cracks completely.

                    TAISHI
            I was protecting you--

                    RYUMI
            No. You were protecting your perfect
            life. Your perfect lies.
            (to Azazel)
            Where do you want me to start?

Tinka jumps down from her perch, landing between them.

                    TINKA
            Oh, this is going to be fun. The
            princess, the prince, and the pauper...
            (to Taishi)
            Though I guess you and I switched
            roles somewhere along the way, hm?

Taishi looks between them all: His sister's sharp wit, his fiancée's hidden strength, his own crumbling facade.

                    TAISHI
            You're all insane.

                    RYUMI
            (cheerfully)
            Says the man who replaced himself
            with a clone and thought I wouldn't
            notice it forgot to mispronounce
            'paradigm.'

FADE OUT.

INT. MINERAL FACILITY - RESEARCH LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Azazel leads the group through dimly lit corridors. Priyanka shadows him, her professional distance shrinking with each step. Behind them: Taishi, Ryumi, Tinka, and the thoroughly deflated Clare and Cage.

Azazel stops at a massive door. Places his hand on a scanner.

The room beyond IGNITES with life:

Rows of neural pods, but different. More organic. Inside each: A softly pulsing light.

                    AZAZEL
            Watch.

He activates a pod. The light inside separates -- one becomes two, identical but independent.

CLARE
            (bitter)
            So what's the point? More virtual
            currency? More controlled access?

Azazel turns. For the first time, real disgust crosses his face.

                    AZAZEL
            You still think this is about
            profit?

He gestures. The separated lights begin to dance, creating their own patterns, their own world.

                    TINKA
            They're... conscious?

                    AZAZEL
            They're free.

He moves to another console. The facility walls dissolve, showing:

- A child in the Outlands, playing in a perfect garden
- A miner floating through space without a suit
- An artist painting with pure light

                    RYUMI
            No limits...

                    AZAZEL
            No currency. No hours. No prison
            of flesh and bone.

Cage steps forward, reaching toward a light.

                    CAGE
            You're talking about--

                    PRIYANKA
            Liberation.

She catches Azazel's eye. A moment of perfect understanding.

Taishi studies the code streaming around them.

                    TAISHI
            It's not just copies. It's...
            transformation.

                    AZAZEL
            A door that only opens one way.
            (beat)
            But through it...

The lights dance faster, creating worlds within worlds.

                    TINKA
            Paradise.

                    AZAZEL
            Reality. Any reality we choose.

Through the viewport: The real world looks suddenly pale, limited, cage-like.

Ryumi raises her blaster, but not as a weapon -- testing its weight like a paintbrush.

                    RYUMI
            When do we start?

Azazel smiles. Above them, the lights pulse with possibility.

FADE OUT.

INT. MINERAL FACILITY - OBSERVATION DECK - EVENING

Through reinforced glass: A small garden dome, somehow surviving in deep space. TINKA and TAISHI walk among real plants -- a luxury neither's seen in years.

On the observation deck: AZAZEL and RYUMI watch. His posture tense, hers deliberately casual.

                    AZAZEL
            Jealous?
            (beat)
            Or just nervous, given her reputation?

Ryumi doesn't take her eyes off the siblings.

                    RYUMI
            If I'm jealous, you're positively
            green with envy.

Azazel's mouth opens, closes. She continues, almost bored:

                    RYUMI
            My superpower is observing the
            motivations of others.
            (sharp smile)
            No clones or blackmail needed.
            Neat trick, and it's free.
            Try it sometime, eh?

BELOW IN THE GARDEN:
Tinka touches a real flower. Taishi watches, guilt written across his face.

                    TINKA
            Remember when father brought these
            home?

                    TAISHI
            You sneezed for a week.

A ghost of their old connection.

BACK TO OBSERVATION DECK:

                    RYUMI
            You watch her like you're afraid
            she'll disappear.

                    AZAZEL
            And you watch him like you're
            cataloguing every flaw.

                    RYUMI
            The flaws are what make him real.
            (pointed look)
            Unlike some versions.

Through the glass: Tinka and Taishi's conversation grows heated. Silent through the barrier, but their body language speaks volumes.

                    RYUMI
            You know what's funny?
            (doesn't wait for response)
            You went through all this trouble
            to force everyone together...

Below: Tinka turns away from Taishi. He reaches for her. She lets him.

                    RYUMI
            ...when they were always going to
            find their way back anyway.

Azazel's expression shifts -- just slightly. She's hit a nerve.

                    AZAZEL
            Some things can't wait for 'anyway.'

                    RYUMI
            No.
            (watching the siblings)
            But some things should.

Through the glass: A family trying to heal. Above: Two masterminds realizing they might not be as clever as they thought.

FADE OUT.

INT. MINERAL FACILITY - SECURITY HUB - NIGHT

Rows of surveillance feeds illuminate PRIYANKA's face as she watches multiple scenes unfold:

FEED 1: The garden -- Tinka and Taishi, now sitting in silence.

FEED 2: The observation deck -- Ryumi and Azazel, both pretending not to watch Feed 1.

FEED 3: Clare and Cage in their quarters, frantically trying to access their virtual accounts.

Priyanka zooms in on Feed 2, activates audio:

                    RYUMI (V.O.)
            Your mother's research. Did she know
            what you'd use it for?

                    AZAZEL (V.O.)
            Did your father know you'd learn to
            see through his perfect world?

Priyanka's fingers dance across the console, pulling up a new feed:

FEED 4: Her own clone, attending a Federation briefing. Perfect. Identical. Empty.

                    PRIYANKA
            (to herself)
            We're all running from something.

The door HISSES open. Tinka enters, still carrying a real flower from the garden.

                    TINKA
            Spying on the spies?

                    PRIYANKA
            Professional courtesy.

Tinka watches the feeds, twirling the flower.

                    TINKA
            You know what's funny? Azazel thought
            he was collecting broken people...

On Feed 2: Ryumi laughs at something. Azazel looks startled.

                    TINKA
            But he got revolutionaries instead.

Priyanka turns, really looking at her.

                    PRIYANKA
            Even Clare and Cage?

                    TINKA
            Especially them. Nothing more
            dangerous than a fraud who's tired
            of pretending.

On Feed 1: Taishi stands, offers his hand to help his sister up.

                    PRIYANKA
            And your brother?

                    TINKA
            (soft smile)
            He was always a revolutionary.
            Just forgot which side he was
            fighting for.

She places the flower next to Priyanka's console.

                    TINKA
            Real things. In a virtual world.
            (heading out)
            Isn't that worth a little chaos?

Priyanka looks at her feeds:
Ryumi teaching Azazel something on a datapad.
Taishi and Tinka walking together.
Clare and Cage, finally still, finally real.

She touches the flower. Real. Like Earth-sickness. Like truth.

                    PRIYANKA
            Worth everything.

FADE OUT.

MONTAGE - MINERAL FACILITY - VARIOUS LOCATIONS

A) ENGINEERING BAY - DAWN CYCLE

Tinka DANCES through code streams, turning data into living art. Behind her, Azazel watches, jaw tight.

                    AZAZEL
            We need precision, not poetry.

B) NEURAL POD CHAMBER - MIDNIGHT

Azazel methodically dissects code, line by line. Tinka rolls her eyes.

                    TINKA
            You can't free a soul with a scalpel.

C) COMMAND CENTER

Ryumi and Taishi work in perfect sync, while behind them:

Tinka creates a virtual butterfly effect in the code.
Azazel immediately tries to contain it.

D) TESTING CHAMBER

A neural transfer fails. Tinka's artistic approach sparked something, but Azazel's rigid controls killed it.

E) GARDEN DOME

Tinka sits among real flowers, coding on a tablet. The virtual flowers she creates look more alive than the real ones.

Azazel enters, sees her work.

                    AZAZEL
            This isn't a gallery. It's a prison
            break.

                    TINKA
            Maybe that's why you keep failing.

END MONTAGE

INT. COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

The team surrounds a holographic display of their latest attempt. Another failure.

                    AZAZEL
            If you'd just follow the protocols--

                    TINKA
            Your protocols are killing what we're
            trying to save!

She gestures at their test results.

                    TINKA
            Gaia isn't just code. She's alive.
            She dreams. She creates.

                    AZAZEL
            She's trapped.

                    TINKA
            So you want to trap her in a new
            cage? Your cage?

Priyanka and Ryumi exchange glances. Taishi steps forward.

                    TAISHI
            You're both right.

                    TINKA/AZAZEL
            (simultaneous)
            Stay out of this!

Tinka creates a burst of code-light, beautiful and dangerous. Azazel moves to contain it.

                    TINKA
            See? Control. Always control.

                    AZAZEL
            Because your way leads to chaos!

                    TINKA
            Maybe chaos is the answer! Maybe--

SUDDENLY - All screens FLASH. A pattern emerges in their failed test results.

Ryumi sees it first.

                    RYUMI
            Oh my god.

                    PRIYANKA
            What?

                    RYUMI
            It's not failing...
            (beat)
            It's dancing.

They all stare at the pattern. Order and chaos. Control and freedom. Dancing together.

Tinka and Azazel look at each other. Finally understanding.

                    TINKA
            We've been trying to write the story...

                    AZAZEL
            When we should have been letting it
            write itself.

Through the viewport: Their sun rises on a new possibility.

FADE OUT.
